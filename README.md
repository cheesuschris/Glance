A project introducing a new form of human-computer interaction, allowing one to communicate to a computer and an LLM with their eyes. This project aims to help the mute and/or those unable to interact with a keyboard.
This project was heavily inspired by the research paper: http://nature.com/articles/s41467-024-53873-3
This project is ALSO a secondary project for the HackPrinceton2025 hackathon, so it is not as fleshed out as the other project.
